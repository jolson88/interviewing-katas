# Interviewing Katas

This repository contains a set of interviewing katas of different varieties. They are intended to be used as a tool to conduct
pair-programming interviews, though they can be used for normal TDD practice as well.

Some of the projects support numbered "stages" that allow the exercise to be started from differing levels of completeness
or complexity.
